# CEES-Automated-Saturation-System
An alternative to classic flow meters, the Automated saturation system can regulate liquid flow using an electronicall controlled valve, a camera and a microcontroller. By tracking pixel changes using OpenCV within a user-designated region of interest it can detect drops even with poor visibility.
